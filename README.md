## Content models required

* The app after [v4.2.0-rc2](https://github.com/sasigume/sasigudotme/releases/tag/v4.2.0-rc2) **requires these content models on your Contentful space** to run :
  * 'skill'
  * 'link'
  * 'work
  * 'profile'
* Optimized layout structure: more features, fewer files.
* Note that PostCSS purge is ignoring 'bg-level-(1~4)' to display skill level.
